## Task 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This is **Task 2** for the Elevate Labs internship, focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis using world population data.

- Dataset includes countries, capitals, continents, and populations from 1970 to 2022.
- Cleaned continent labels (e.g., replaced "Oceania" with "Australia" where appropriate).
- Explored numerical features with histograms and boxplots.
- Analyzed population trends across years and continents.
- Visualized 2022 population distribution, most populous countries, and density comparisons.
- Created pie charts and boxplots to show population spread by continent.
